"""
sensorkit package
A small in-class sensor data toolkit assembled by the whole team.

This file is the ASSEMBLY step (done together once every module is complete).
It exposes the public API so a user can simply write:

    from sensorkit import Thermocouple, load_readings, summarise

If you add a StrainGauge class in sensors.py, add it to the import below too.
